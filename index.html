        <p>Glad to meet you! I'm Alice, a wife, mother of five, and grandma to four
            living in Pleasant Grove, Utah, USA. In 2019 I retired from a career in
            Manufacturing Engineering to make time for family members who need extra care.
            Now I am studying Software Development through BYU Pathway Worldwide. The
            opportunity to meet other students from all over the world is bringing me so
            much joy! I love learning new things, reading good books, cooking yummy food, and
            rowing on the Great Salt Lake.</p>

        <p>Living here is awesome! Utah has 5 incredible national parks,
            world-class skiing, and amazing mountains for hiking, camping,
            and mountain biking. Utah hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics and is
            also the headquarters for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
